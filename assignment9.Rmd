***How to do it?***: 

- Open the Rmarkdown file of this assignment ([link](assignment9.Rmd)) in Rstudio. 

- Right under each **question**, insert  a code chunk (you can use the hotkey `Ctrl + Alt + I` to add a code chunk) and code the solution for the question. 

- `Knit` the rmarkdown file (hotkey: `Ctrl + Alt + K`) to export an html.  

-  Publish the html file to your Githiub Page. 

***Submission***: Submit the link on Github of the assignment to Canvas

```{r setup, include=FALSE}

**Notice:** *In this assignment, all the plot should have title, caption, and axis labels. *

1. Use the dataset by of covid 19 by WHO at https://covid19.who.int/WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv. Find the three countries with the most numbers of deaths by Covid-19. 

Hint: 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df <- read_csv("WHO-COVID-19-global-data.csv")
```


-  Use `filter` to select the most current date 
```{r}

df %>% filter(Date_reported == max(Date_reported))
```

-  Pipe with `arrange(-Cumulative_deaths)` to rank the data by the number of cumulative deaths
```{r}
df %>% filter(Date_reported == max(Date_reported)) %>% arrange(-Cumulative_deaths)
```


2. Use `transition_reveal` to make a plot revealing the number of deaths in the three countries with the most numbers of deaths
```{r}
library(gganimate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
df %>% filter(Date_reported == max(Date_reported)) %>% arrange(-Cumulative_deaths) %>% top_n(3,Cumulative_deaths) 

plot1 <- df %>% filter(Country %in% c('United States of America','Brazil','India')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=Cumulative_deaths,
            x=Date_reported,
            color=Country))+ 
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  transition_reveal(Date_reported)
plot1

```

3. Create the new variable (column) `death_per_cases` recording the number of deaths per cases (Hint: divide cumulative deaths by cumulative cases).  What are the three countries with the highest deaths per cases? 
```{r}
df$death_per_cases = df$Cumulative_deaths / df$Cumulative_cases
df %>% filter(Date_reported == max(Date_reported)) %>% arrange(-death_per_cases) %>% top_n(3,death_per_cases)

```


4. Use `transition_reveal` to make a plot revealing the number of deaths per cases of the US, Italy and Mexico. 
```{r}
plot <- df %>% filter(Country %in% c('United States of America','Italy','Mexico')) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=death_per_cases,
            x=Date_reported,
            color=Country))+ 
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(size=3)+
  transition_reveal(Date_reported)
plot
```


5. Import the following data https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv
                      
Use `transition_reveal` to plot the total vaccinations per hundred by level of income. Hint: the levels of income are identified in the `location` variable. Put a short comment on the caption of the plot. 

```{r}
df <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owid/covid-19-data/master/public/data/vaccinations/vaccinations.csv")

plot <- df %>% filter(location %in% c("Lower middle income", "Low income", "Upper middle income")) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y=total_vaccinations_per_hundred,
            x=date,
            color=location))+ 
  geom_line()+
  geom_point(size=1)+
  transition_reveal(date)+
  labs(caption = 'R is infact a pretty cool software')
plot
```
