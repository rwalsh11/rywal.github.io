## Instruction

The midterm has two components: the Rmarkdown notebook (html) and the presentation.  We will do the presentation in class. Post both the notebook and the presentation on your Github page. 

**The notebook:** The notebook should be created using `rmarkdown` (like other assignments). The notebook should have a title. It should have a table of content (TOC form) or in a tab form. The Rmd files of Tab and Toc form are available on the class webpage. 

**The Presentation:** Present your results in 5-10 minutes. To make the presentation using Rmarkdown, do the follows: 

    - In Rstudio -> File -> New File -> R markdown
    
    - In the left panel, click to Presentation -> Click OK
    
    - Now you have an Rmarkdown that can be knitted to be a html presentation 
    
- You can also use Rmd samples of the class slides that are available on the class webpage. 
    
- You do not need to rerun all the codes for the presentation. For example, to show the model comparison, you just need to show the image of the model comparison instead of running all the models again.
    
- To inset an image in a slide, use  `![](image.png)`

- To scale images, you can follow these below instructions. 
    
    - https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/figure-size.html
    
    - http://zevross.com/blog/2017/06/19/tips-and-tricks-for-working-with-images-and-figures-in-r-markdown-documents/

- To turn off message and warning of a code cell, use:  `{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}` for the cell. 

**What to present**:

  - Present Part 2 - Visualization
  
  - Present Question Question 4, 5 and 6 in Part 3.  
  
  - Present any errors/challenges you run into and how you fix/overcome them. 

**Data:**  

The data for the mid-term project is the Rhode Island Department of Health Hospital Discharge Data.  Each row of the data presents a patient.

## I. Data Wranggling

1. Download the data file `hdd0318cy.sas7bdat`.  

2. Use `read_sas` in library `haven` to read the data. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(haven)
setwd("C:\\Users\\student\\Desktop")
df <- read_sas("hdd0318cy.sas7bdat")
setwd("C:/Users/student/Desktop/R Math421/rwalsh11.github.io/")

```
    
3. Filter the data to have only patients of the year 2018 (`yod=2018`)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
df1 <- df %>% filter(yod=='18')

```
4. Select to work with only following variables: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
                      "yod", "payfix","pay_ub92","age",  
                      "sex","raceethn","provider","moa", 
                      "yoa","mod","admtype", "asource" , 
                      "preopday" ,"los", "service" , "icu","ccu",    
                      "dispub92", "payer"  ,"drg","trandb", 
                      "randbg","randbs","orr", "anes","seq",   
                      "lab","dtest", "ther","blood","phar", 
                      "other","patcon","bwght","total","tot" ,  
                      "ecodub92","b_wt","pt_state","diag_adm","ancilar" ,
                      "campus","er_fee","er_chrg","er_mode","obs_chrg",
                      "obs_hour","psycchrg","nicu_day"
```

*Notice*:  You may want to save the current data to your computer for easy access later.  To save the data file use `write_csv(df, 'midterm.csv')`, for example.  
```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
df1 <- df1 %>% select("yod", "payfix","pay_ub92","age",  
                      "sex","raceethn","provider","moa", 
                      "yoa","mod","admtype", "asource" , 
                      "preopday" ,"los", "service" , "icu","ccu",    
                      "dispub92", "payer"  ,"drg","trandb", 
                      "randbg","randbs","orr", "anes","seq",   
                      "lab","dtest", "ther","blood","phar", 
                      "other","patcon","bwght","total","tot" ,  
                      "ecodub92","b_wt","pt_state","diag_adm","ancilar" ,
                      "campus","er_fee","er_chrg","er_mode","obs_chrg",
                      "obs_hour","psycchrg","nicu_day")
library(tidyverse)
write_csv(df1, 'midterm.csv')
```
5. What are variables that have missing values?
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
df1 <- read_csv("midterm.csv")
colSums(is.na(df1))

```
6. Remove all variables with missing values. 
```{r}
df1 %>% select(-nicu_day,-er_mode,-obs_hour,-ecodub92,-payfix,-diag_adm,-bwght,-preopday)
```

data wrangling to  better view providers
```{r}
df1$provider1 <- case_when(df1$provider == 7201 ~ "Newport", df1$provider == 7202 ~ "St. Joseph Health Services of RI",df1$provider == 7203 ~ "Memorial",df1$provider == 7204 ~ "Miriam",df1$provider == 7205 ~ "Rhode Island Hospital",df1$provider == 7206 ~ "Roger Williams",df1$provider == 7209 ~ "South County",df1$provider == 7210 ~ "Kent County",df1$provider == 7211 ~ "Westerly",df1$provider == 7212 ~ "Rehab of RI",df1$provider == 7213 ~ "Landmark Medical Center",df1$provider == 7214 ~ "Women and Infants",df1$provider == 7215 ~ "Bradley",df1$provider == 7216 ~ "Butler",)
```

7. Refer to the data description in the file `HDD2015-18cy6-20-19.docx`, which variable recording the month of admission?, which variable recording the month of discharge?
```{r}
table(df1$moa)
table(df1$mod)
#neither of these work(having major trouble viewing data)
```

8. Which month admitted the most number of patients? Which month admitted the most number of male patients?
```{r}
table(df1$moa)
q8 <-  df1 %>%  filter(sex == 1)
table(q8$moa)
```
The males make up for about half of all admissions, month 10, October appears to be the month with the most admitted patients both with respect to everyone and with respect to just men. 

9. Which month has the most number of teenage female patients?
```{r}
q9 <- df1 %>% filter(sex == 2, age < 20)
table(q9$moa) #month 5 is best
```
10. Which provider has the most number of female patients in October? 
```{r}
table(df1$provider)
q10 <- df1 %>% filter(sex == 2,moa ==10) 
table(q10$provider)
```
provider number 7205(rhode island hopsital) has the most ammount of female patients in october. 

11. Are female patients older than male patients, on average? 
```{r}
d1 <- df1 %>% group_by(sex == 1) %>% summarise(mean = mean(age))
d2 <- df1 %>% group_by(sex == 2) %>% summarise(mean = mean(age))
d1
d2
```
12. Calculate the average age of patients by months. Which month has the oldest patients on average age?
```{r}
d3 <- df1 %>% group_by(moa) %>% summarise(mean = mean(age))
d3
```
13. What is the name of the provider that has the highest total charge?
```{r}
q13 <- df1 %>% group_by(provider) %>% summarise(max =max(tot))
q13
max(q13) #Woman and infants 
```
14. What is the name of the provider that has the least total charge for teenage male on average?
```{r}
df1$total <- as.numeric(df1$total)
df1 %>% filter(sex == 1) %>%  group_by(provider1) %>% summarise(mean = mean(total))
```
15. Create a season (Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter) variable. Calculate the length of stays by season.  Which season has the longest length of stays on average?
```{r}

df1$season <- case_when(df1$moa %in% c("3","4","5") ~ 'spring',
                       df1$moa %in% c("6","7","8") ~ 'summer', df1$moa %in% c("9","10","11") ~ 'fall', df1$moa %in% c("12","1","2") ~ 'winter')

df1 %>% group_by(season) %>% summarise(mean = mean(los))
```
16. On average, how much a 20 year-old male get charged for staying 1 day in the Fall season?
```{r}

q16 <- df1 %>%  filter(sex == 1, los == 1, age == 20, season == "fall") 
q16 %>% summarise(mean = mean(tot))
```
17. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. You could do some other calculations to support your points. 
```{r, eval=FALSE}
#this section was very useful in terms of us cleaning and begining to visualize the data set we are working with. After removing variables in which were missing values, we were still able to see ways in which this data can and will be used. another thing to note is as I did the required stratification I discovered interesting things with respect to comparative stratification. For example when investigating how much on average a 20 year old male spends on a one night stay which we found to be $16511.00, however what is interesting is that with respect to a female in the same position it is $9676.182. These kinds of differences are significant and should be investigated further.
```

## II. Data Visualization

Continue with the data from part I. 

1. Provides at least 10 meaningful plots. Comments on the plots. All plots should have title, caption, appropriate labels on x and y-axis
```{r}
df1$sex1 <- case_when(df1$sex == 1 ~ 'male',df1$sex == 2 ~ 'female', df1$sex == 9 ~'Other')
```


```{r}
m8 <- df1 %>% filter(dispub92 %in% c("01","02","03","04","05","09","20","50","51","62","65","70")) %>% ggplot(aes(x = dispub92, color = sex1))+
  geom_bar()+
  labs(x = "status/location of patient(Disposition)",y = "Count",title = 'Bar graph of frequency of discharges stratified by sex', caption = "The top 12 dispositions for individuals. The most frequent appears to be a Routine discharge(01) to home or self care.")
ggsave(filename = 'Dispotion.png', plot = m8)
m8
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
m7 <- df1 %>% ggplot() + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=age, y=los)) + facet_wrap(~sex1) +

       y = 'total expenses', 
       title = 'total expenses by Age and sex', 
       caption = 'Once again we see indiviudals who are young(< 10 years old) accounting for some of our highest expenses, due to their long lenth of stay as well this makes sense that their total expenses are more.')
ggsave(filename = 'AgevTot.png', plot = m6)
m6
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
m5 <- df1 %>% ggplot() + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=los, y=tot)) + facet_wrap(~provider1) +

m5
```

```{r}
#teenagers
m4 <- df1 %>% filter(age <= 20) %>% ggplot(aes(y = provider1,

  geom_col()+
  labs(title = 'Total expenses by provider and gender',x = "Total expenses",y = "Provider", caption = "as observed in the scatterplot earlier we also see Woman and Infants as well as Rhode Island hospital being the most expensive. Bradley appears to work with predominantly male patients.")
ggsave(filename = 'LosProvTeen.png', plot = m4)
m4
```

```{r}
m3 <- df1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = moa,y= tot,
            color=sex1))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = 'moa vs total room and board', x = "Month of Admition", y = "Total expenses", caption = "August and October appear to have a higher total cost. This could be due to the increase in patients during these months.")
m3
ggsave(filename = 'Moatrandb.png', plot = m3)
```


```{r}
m11 <- df1 %>%group_by(moa,sex1) %>%  summarise(mean = mean(tot)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = moa,y= mean,

```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df1 %>% ggplot(aes(x = campus,
           , color=sex1))+
  geom_bar() 
#this was to view frequency of individuals on campus to assist in interpreting total expenses vs campus
```


```{r}
m2 <- df1 %>% group_by(campus, sex1) %>% summarise(mean = mean(tot)) %>% ggplot(aes(x = campus,
           y = mean, color=sex1))+
  geom_col()+
  labs(title = 'total expenses by Hospital campus', x = "Hospital Campus", y = "Total Expenses", caption = "The total expenses appears to be higher in campus 3 which is Rhode Island Hospital - Adult, this is important to note because the scatter plots we saw showed high expenses with respect to kids.")
m2
ggsave(filename = 'TotbyHos.png', plot = m2)
```

```{r}

m1 <- df1 %>% ggplot() + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=los, y=tot, color = sex1)) + facet_wrap(~provider1) +
  labs(x='Length of Stay', 
       y = 'Total Charge',

```


```{r}

m10 <- graph %>% ggplot(aes(x = pt_state, y = mean
           ))+

  labs(x='Total Expenses', 
       y='Provider',
       fill = 'Season', 
       title = 'total expenses by provider and season', 
       caption = 'Rhode Island Hospital shows the highest toal expenses.There appears minimal variation between seasons for each hospital.')
m9
ggsave(filename = 'totvProv.png', plot = m9)
```

2. Make an animation plot. 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(gganimate)
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
a1 <- df1 %>% ggplot() + geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = sex, fill = trandb)) + 
  transition_states(age) + 
  labs(x='Sex', 
       y='Total room and board charge',
       title = 'Age: {closest_state}')
animate(a1,nframes = 10)
```

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(gganimate)
library(ggplot2)
df1$avgtot <- case_when(df1$tot >= 34317.18	~"above average",df1$tot <= 34317.18	~ "below average")
d1 <- df1 %>% group_by(moa,sex1,avgtot,age) %>% summarise(mean = mean(tot))
d2 <- d1 %>% group_by(moa) %>% mutate(rank=rank(-mean)) 
a1 <- d2 %>% ggplot(aes(x=moa, y=mean, group=avgtot, fill=sex1, label=sex1)) + geom_col()+geom_text(aes(y = mean, label = sex1), hjust = 4)+
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 1, size = 22),
          axis.ticks.y = element_blank(),
          axis.text.y  = element_blank()) + 
    transition_states(age)+
    ease_aes("cubic-in-out")
animate(a1, nframes = 10)
```


```{r}
library(gganimate)
library(ggplot2)
df1$avgtot <- case_when(df1$tot >= 34317.18	~"above average",df1$tot <= 34317.18	~ "below average")
df1$trandb <- as.numeric(df1$trandb)
d1 <- df1 %>% group_by(moa,sex1,avgtot,age) %>% summarise(mean = mean(trandb, na.rm=TRUE))

a1 <- d1 %>% ggplot(aes(x=age, y=mean, color = sex1)) + geom_col()+labs(x = "Age",y = "Average Room and Board Cost", title = 'moa {closest_state}',fill = "Sex")+
    transition_states(moa)
animate(a1, nframes = 400)
```


3. Write a paragraph to summarize the section and give your comments on the results. 

```{r,eval=FALSE}
The graphs produced allowed for us to get a good visualization to understand how/if stratifying by season or sex allows us to better understand the positive corrected relationship between total expenses and length of stay. We saw a consistent even split between male in females for most graphs, one notable exception is Bradley hospital which had males account for more of the total expenses. 
```

## III. Predictive Models

Continue with the data from part I. Make sure you do not have any missing values in the data. Use the follows as the target and input variables: 

*Target Variable*: Create the target variable taking value of 
```{r}
df1 %>% 
  summarise(median(tot))
```
  - `low` if the total charge of a patient (`tot`) is smaller than the median of the total charge, and

  - `high` otherwise. 
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
df1$tot <- case_when(
  df1$tot <16228	 ~ 'low',
  TRUE ~ 'high'
)
df1 <- df1 %>% rename(target=tot)

df1 <- df1 %>% 
  mutate(target = as.factor(target),)
df2 <- df1 %>% select(age,sex,raceethn,provider,moa,mod,admtype,campus, los,target)
```
*Input Variables*:

  - "age","sex","raceethn","provider","moa","mod","admtype","campus", 'los'
```{r}
df2 <- df1 %>% select(age,sex,raceethn,provider,moa,mod,admtype,campus, los,target)
```
-------

1. Use `filter` function to filter out rows where `raceethn==''` or `admtype==''`. Make sure all the categorical variables are factor, numeric variables are numeric. Set Training : Testing Split = 10 : 90 
```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(2020)
df2 <- df2 %>% filter(!raceethn == "")
df2 <- drop_na(df2)
                                            
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df2$target, p = .1, 
                                  list = FALSE)
df_train <- df2[ splitIndex,]
df_test <- df2[-splitIndex,]
```
2. Train a decision tree using `rpart`.  Plot the decision tree. Plot the variable importance ranked by the tree. 
```{r}
library(rpart)
tree_model <- rpart(target ~ ., data = df_train,
                 control = rpart.control(maxdepth = 3))
library(rattle)
fancyRpartPlot(tree_model)
tree_model$variable.importance
barplot(tree_model$variable.importance)
pred <- predict(tree_model, df_test, type = "class")
cm <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target)
cm$overall[1]
```
3. Using caret for this question. Set `Training Control` to be: Use Cross-Validation of 5 folds across all models.  Train & tune at least 2 different models (i.e. two different values for `method=` in the train function of caret).  Plot the hyper-parameter tuning plots for each model. 
```{r}
library(caret)

tuneGrid = expand.grid(maxdepth = 2:10)

trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)

tree_approach2 <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                                method = "rpart2", 
                                trControl = trControl,
                                tuneGrid = tuneGrid)

```

```{r}
library(caret)
tuneGrid = expand.grid(mtry = 2:4,
                       splitrule = c('gini'),
                       min.node.size = c(1:10))

trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)

tree_approach3 <- train(target~., data=df_train, 
                                method = "ranger", 
                                trControl = trControl,
                                tuneGrid = tuneGrid)

```
4. Plot the comparison of the models in 3. 
```{r}
plot(tree_approach2)
print(tree_approach2)
pred <- predict(tree_approach2, df_test)
cm0 <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target)
cm0$overall[1]
```

```{r}
plot(tree_approach3)
print(tree_approach3)
pred <- predict(tree_approach3, df_test)
cm1 <- confusionMatrix(data = pred, reference = df_test$target)
cm1$overall[1]

```

5. What is your final selection for the model? Test the accuracy of your final model on the test data. 
```{r}
cm$overall[1]#original
cm0$overall[1]#treeplot2
cm1$overall[1]#treeplot3
#highest accuracy appears to be my third model which was a model trained through the ranger process.
```

6. Create another `target` variable (binary), decide the input variables and redo 1 to 5. 

```{r}
df1 <- df1 %>% rename(target1=los)#new target(have not established anything else)

df1 <- df1 %>% 
  mutate(target1 = as.factor(target1),)
df2 <- df1 %>% select(age,sex,raceethn,provider,moa,mod,admtype,campus, target1,target)
```


```{r}
library(caret)
set.seed(2020) 
df2 <- df2 %>% filter(!raceethn=='') 
splitIndex <- createDataPartition(df2$target1, p = .10, 
                                  list = FALSE)
df_train <- df2[ splitIndex,]
df_test <- df2[-splitIndex,]

tuneGrid = expand.grid(maxdepth = 2:10)

trControl = trainControl(method = "cv",
                         number = 5)

tree_approach2 <- train(target~., data=df_train,
